# DesignPatternsInScala
This repo has design patterns implemented in both the OO sense and using functional features from Scala. I have to give 
big credit to Pavel Fatin's blog post: https://pavelfatin.com/design-patterns-in-scala/#command

I tried to keep most of the code inside a single file to help keep the context of each design pattern in one place.

I am always looking for advice on better ways to write Scala so do not hesitate to make improvements.
